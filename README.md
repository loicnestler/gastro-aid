# GastroAid

### Description
GastroAid is an open source based tool, which is intended to reduce foodwaste in the gastronomy. 
Foodproduction is contributing 21%-31% to the human made greenhouse gas emissions.
The calculation includes factors such as the weather, the current calendar day (holidays etc.), Google traffic, sales trends and restaurant capacities.

Since our tool is open source, any gastro business is welcome to use it.
We are very concerned that our software contributes to the reduction of foodwaste and to stopping the greenhouse effect. 

#### We also invite everyone to join us and to help us to develop our project!
